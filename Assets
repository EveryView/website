Hi Debasish,

GitHub is the main tool used by software engineer like youself. It is an online project hosting and includes source-code browser, in-line editing and ticketing. It’s base on Git, the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system, similar to Subversion or CVS.

It is important part of this project as we can both work on same document and maintain good version control. Please upload work to it

I. If you navigate to https://github.com/prosy/website/blob/master/Website%20html%20code
 
You can add a new file by clicking the “+” button.

1) Upload the new html code and files you have
2) Use the text edits I made in file “Website html code”. That file contains the edited datasnap.io/index html with my new text edits.

It is much easier this way, as we can share the files and not require too much “search and replace”.

II. Here is the link to temporary logo jpg, resized and transparent background. I have the designer making a “clean” copy, but use this one for now.
