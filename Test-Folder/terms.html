                        THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE DEVELOPER PLATFORM, THE API, DATASNAP.IO’S SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS
                        OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVI CES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE
                        COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. These API Terms, including the documents
                        incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Datasnap.io with respect to the Developer Platform, and
                        supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Developer Platform. These API Terms create no third party beneficiary
                        rights. Datasnap.io’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining
                        provisions of the API Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may
                        not assign any of your rights in these API Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Datasnap.io may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or
                        subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Datasnap.io and you are not legal partners or agents; instead,
                        our relationship is that of independent contractors.
